Ex:-Navigations,data fectching

create react app doesn't provide the navigations

Navigations:- We will depend on the third party library called as React-Router-Dom

React-Router-Dom allows react to provide internal application navigations

we don't use anchor tags for internal redirections(anchor tag doen't have the state linking way in the react)

for installation:
npm i react-router-dom
